# chinese-helper
Utilities to help Chinese learning, such as inserting Zhuyin in a Word document via VBA and Python.

##  Important note
* After your `pip install -r requirements.txt`, download [my branch of dragonmapper here](https://github.com/WataRain/dragonmapper) and replace your environment's **dragonmapper** folder with the one in the branch
* This is because the `transcriptions.csv` found in the PyPI is incomplete, not including syllables such as o5 (ㄛ˙) (which is why you sometimes get "ValueError: Not a valid syllable: o5" or something similar)

## Future prospects
* Per-paragraph translation
